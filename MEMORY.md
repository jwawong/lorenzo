# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Context

## Project: AllMap (The "Chaotic Globe")
**Core Concept:** A multi-layered map application combining "Utility" (specific paid layers) and "Fun" (public painted globe/game).
**Goal:** Achieve "World-Changing Money" and "Freedom" (Digital Nomad life).

### Monetization Strategy (The "Trojan Horse")
*   **Utility First (The Job):** Build predictable income via subscription/paid layers.
    *   *VanLife/Nomad Layer:* "Stop Sleeping at Walmart." Safe parking, reliable WiFi (upload speed/noise rated).
    *   *Film Scout Layer:* Locations by "Vibe" (Cyberpunk, Cottagecore) for photographers/directors.
    *   *Foraging Layer:* Private layers for mushroom hunters; sell "Burn Maps".
*   **Fun Second (The Lottery Ticket):** The public "Painted Globe".
    *   *Sponsorship/Leaderboard:* Businesses (e.g., Tour Groups) paint regions to own the leaderboard. They pay to "Sponsor" the region (digital billboard).
    *   *Virtual Real Estate:* Users buy "Permanent Paint" or "Protected Tiles".

### Marketing Strategy
*   **Campaign A (Honey):** "Paint the World" (Viral/Awareness) -> Low friction, gets users in.
*   **Campaign B (Hammer):** Retarget with "Stop Sleeping at Walmart" (Utility/Sales) -> High ROI.

### Technical Foundation ("The Metal")
*   **Grid:** Structured pixel/hex grid (not random chaos).
*   **Stack:** Python (Backend), Android App, Frontend (React/JSX?).
*   **Status:** Core painting, competition, and leaderboard models exist.
