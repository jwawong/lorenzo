## 📐 Camera Angles & Framing
- **The "Hero" Low Angle:** Camera positioned low, looking up at subject. Convey power, dominance, or triumph. *Ref: The Matrix lobby scene.*
- **extreme_close_up_eye:** Extreme close-up on an eye. Used for intense emotion or realization. *Ref: Requiem for a Dream.*
- **Over-the-Shoulder (OTS) Dirty:** Classic conversation shot, but "dirty" (foreground shoulder is out of focus and prominent). Adds intimacy/voyeurism.
- **God's Eye View:** 90-degree top-down shot. Good for geography, patterns, or feeling detached. *Ref: Wes Anderson films.*

## 🎬 Camera Movement
- **The "Spielberg" Oner:** A long, flowing tracking shot that moves between different compositions without cutting.
- **Whip Pan:** Fast pan that blurs the image, used as a dynamic transition between scenes or to reveal something suddenly.
- **Dolly Zoom (Vertigo Effect):** Dolly forward while zooming out (or vice versa). Creates a disorienting, warping effect. *Ref: Jaws, Vertigo.*
- **Handheld "Documentary" Shake:** Slight, intentional jitter to feel raw, immediate, and real.

## 💡 Lighting & Mood
- **Chiaroscuro (High Contrast):** Stark contrast between light and dark. Dramatic, moody, film noir style.
- **Golden Hour Backlight:** Subject lit from behind by low sun. Creates a halo effect/rim light. Romantic, nostalgic.
- **Neon Noir:** High contrast with saturated colors (pinks, cyans, purples). *Ref: Blade Runner 2049.*
