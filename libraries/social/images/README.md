# 🖼️ Social Media Image Assets

Drop your image files here (JPG, PNG, WEBP).
The **Social Media Researcher/Writer** will look in this folder for visual assets to attach to drafts.

## How to Reference in Posts
When you add an image here (e.g., `libraries/social/images/cool-chart.png`), the agent can reference it like this:
`[ATTACH: libraries/social/images/cool-chart.png]`

## Personalization
- Add your profile photos.
- Add branded templates/backgrounds.
- Add specific "vibe" images you want the agent to use as inspiration.
